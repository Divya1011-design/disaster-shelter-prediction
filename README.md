# Predictive Shelter Demand Analysis for Disaster Preparedness

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses the **EM-DAT (Emergency Events Database)**, which records historical natural disasters worldwide, to predict shelter and evacuation demands during future disasters.  
The goal is to leverage **machine learning** to analyze past disaster events (floods, earthquakes, cyclones, etc.) and estimate the number of people affected, fatalities, and economic losses.  

By predicting shelter demand, this project aims to support **better disaster preparedness, resource allocation, and emergency planning**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Natural disasters cause massive displacement of people and strain on emergency services. Relief agencies often struggle to estimate the number of shelters, supplies, and medical support required.  
This project builds a **predictive model** to estimate the **population affected** in future disasters, based on historical disaster event data.
